RAID0 		Also called “striping”. The capacity of such volume is the sum of the capacities of all disks. 
			But RAID0 does not add any redundancy, so the failure of a single drive makes the volume unusable.

RAID1		Also called “mirroring”. Data is written identically to all disks. 
			This mode requires at least 2 disks with the same size. 
			The resulting capacity is that of a single disk.

RAID10 		A combination of RAID0 and RAID1. Requires at least 4 disks.

RAIDZ-1 	A variation on RAID-5, single parity. Requires at least 3 disks.

RAIDZ-2     A variation on RAID-5, double parity. Requires at least 4 disks.

RAIDZ-3		A variation on RAID-5, triple parity. Requires at least 5 disks.
